## The Map App

WORK IN PROGRESS

The Map App will be a web app that will let users input what countries in the world they have travelled to. When they have the app will show them how much of the world they have sen as a % and give them a list of countries they have yet to visit. So they can find inspiration for where they would like to go to next.

This project is an exercise to practice with Java Script. The plan is to build The Mapp App using TDD. And following an Agile methodology (of sorts, this is a solo project) using a Trello board to track progress.
